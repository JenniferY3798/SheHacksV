                    <span class="about-content">Plenty of people go vegan to minimize the impact of their meals on the environment. As we all know, the production of meat and fast food is overwhelmingly detrimental to the earth, in many ways more than one. <br><hr style="height:20px; visibility:hidden;" />

                        But what if we told you that many substitutes aren’t as ‘friendly’ as many people think? What if we told you that chicken requires 518 gallons of water per pound, but lentils require even more (704 gallons per pound, to be exact)? And that one glass of almond milk requires 74 litres of water to be produced? <br><hr style="height:20px; visibility:hidden;" />
                        
                        This calculator will calculate exactly how much of Earth’s resources went into making your meal: the amount of water used, the amount of carbon emitted into the atmosphere, and the land area used to produce the ingredients. This calculator will enable you to see your direct impact on the Earth meal by meal, and allow you to choose smart alternatives. <br><hr style="height:20px; visibility:hidden;" /></span>
